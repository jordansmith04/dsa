     * Given a bunch of points, compute the smallest path that encompasses all the points
     *
     * Example: src/ConvexHull.png
     *
     * Steps:
     * 1. Choose the starting vertex (p) with the lowest Y value (Closest to x axis)
     * 2. Sort points by their angle from p, moving counter clock wise
     * 3. Discard unless it creates a counter clockwise turn
     *
